THE EVIDENCE - How long these APIs have existed:

window.open() 
  First appeared: Netscape Navigator 2.0 - December 1995 (30 YEARS OLD)

localStorage
  First appeared: HTML5 spec - Late 2000s (~2009) (16 YEARS OLD)

Fullscreen API
  First appeared: ~2011-2012 (Firefox 10 in 2012) (13 YEARS OLD)

screen.width / screen.height
  First appeared: Original JavaScript - 1995 (30 YEARS OLD)

Google's Window Management API: Started 2018, Shipped 2022 (4 years)

The APIs existed for DECADES. They chose complexity anyway.

Instead of using 30-year-old APIs that already worked

Earliest evidence of Window Management API dates back to 2018-2019:

THE QUESTION EVERY SHAREHOLDER, USER, AND COMPANY SHOULD ASK:

The Window Management API is marketed as "free."

Is it really?

COMPANIES PAY:
- Technical consultants to change backend infrastructure
- Developer time learning the new API (vs using window.open())
- Permission prompt rejection (how many users will they lose)
- Ongoing maintenance (Chrome-only = vendor lock-in)

USERS PAY:
- Privacy loss (permission prompts = more data collection)
- Worse UX (chromeless windows, permission friction)
- Exclusion (Firefox/Safari users blocked)
- Higher prices (companies pass costs to customers)

How long before these costs are passed to the end user?

That's you, sitting at the bottom of the Silicon Extraction Stack.

30-year-old APIs, what does that say about:

1. Credentialism in tech hiring
2. Corporate incentives vs. user needs  
3. "Innovation" as performance theater
4. Complexity as job security

The simple solution existed all along.

They chose not to use it.

Ask yourself why.
